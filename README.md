In our implement of the algorithms, we use the following packages developed by other researchers:

the "TFOCS" package by Becker et al. (https://github.com/cvxr/TFOCS);

the "AIR Tools II" package by Hansen and Jorgensen (https://github.com/jakobsj/AIRToolsII);

the "toolbox_signal" and "toolbox_general" packages by Peyre (https://github.com/gpeyre/numerical-tours/tree/master/matlab).

We also thank Dr. Wuchen Li for sharing his codes for the Earth mover's distance experiment (http://www.math.snu.ac.kr/~ernestryu/code/OMT/OMT_code.zip).
